# EDA on Health and Sleep Data

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook on health and sleep data. The notebook was originally created on Kaggle by [adilshamim8](https://www.kaggle.com/adilshamim8) and has been uploaded here for further exploration and collaboration.

## Overview

The project investigates various aspects of health and sleep patterns using real-world data. Key objectives include:
- Understanding trends and correlations in health and sleep metrics.
- Visualizing data distributions and relationships through charts and graphs.
- Identifying potential insights that could inform personal health or further research.

## Data

*Note:* The dataset used in this notebook is sourced from Kaggle. Due to licensing and size considerations, the raw data is not included in this repository. Please refer to the original dataset on Kaggle for more details and to download it.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** – Programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization libraries.
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Environment used for interactive analysis.

## Installation

To run the notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, install the following libraries:*

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```

## Usage

1. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Visit the original Kaggle notebook and download the dataset, or follow the instructions provided there.

2. **Launch the Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open the Notebook:**
   - Navigate to the notebook file (e.g., `EDA_on_Health_and_Sleep_Data.ipynb`) and run the cells to explore the analysis.

## Notebook Details

- **EDA Steps:** The notebook guides you through data cleaning, exploratory visualization, and insights extraction.
- **Visualizations:** Various plots and graphs are generated to showcase trends and correlations within the data.
- **Insights:** The analysis helps highlight interesting patterns in health metrics and sleep quality, which could be a foundation for further research.
